# RENAC-MODBUS

I plan to develop a modbus interface with the RENAC inverter. I found the modbus documentation  https://github.com/HA1Andrzej/RENAC-MODBUS/blob/main/RenacPower_On-Grid%20Inverter%20Modbus%20Protocol%20V0.02.pdf

I am looking for people who own Renac inverters and want to make/test such communication with HA.

Do you know how to make such communication? Please contact me. I think that together we can make it possible!

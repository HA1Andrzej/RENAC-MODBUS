# RENAC-MODBUS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The code is just running, there may be problems!

##**Remember to copy the Custom Component renac.h file to the ESPHome folder in Home Assistant !!**

I used the example of communications [htvekov/solivia_esphom](https://github.com/htvekov/solivia_esphome)

Renac inverters

The package request command can instead easily be send from ESPHome using ```uart.write``` and e.g. triggered via the ESPHome Time component.

Example: 
```
time:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: esptime
  - platform: sntp
    on_time:
       // Request package every 10 seconds from inverter at slave address: 0x01
      - seconds: /10
        then:
          - uart.write: [0x02, 0x05, 0x01, 0x02, 0x60, 0x01, 0x85, 0xFC, 0x03]

```

ðŸ’¡ A list of all Renac inverters registers and the communication protocol is now finally publicly available and can be found [here](https://github.com/HA1Andrzej/RENAC-MODBUS/blob/main/RenacPower_On-Grid%20Inverter%20Modbus%20Protocol%20V0.02.pdf).

I've tested on ESP32 with hardware UART. I experience minor ESPHome <--> Home Assistant connection issues using the ESP32 software UART. So I've revised my production config to use the hardware UART pins instead. This is rock solid. But remember to turn off debug communication on the UART pins.

A few of the 'public known' commands have been tested. Most unfortunately did fail. Haven't really spend much time on testing further commands, as all the data i need is in gateway package.
```
          - uart.write: [0x01, 0x65, 0x04, 0x29, 0x04, 0x00, 0x1B, 0x29, 0xCC, 0x00, 0x10, 0x2A, 0x30, 0x00, 0x11, 0x2E, 0xE0, 0x00, 0x06, 0xFF, 0xD7]
```
